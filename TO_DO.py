Create a dic to store all found job details(location and title, when job was posted, and job link)
Perform first filter on the dic by looking at when job was posted and only take recently posted jobs
Iterate through filtered dic to look through all the links
perform second filter on the links - filter based on keywords in job description, job requirements and salary ranges 
return a clean dic of desired jobs to apply for



other plans - get working with other jobs sites so you can post multiple site links in a at time and filter all (linkdin, indeed, glassdoor, etc)
maybe make some sore of user interface to add experience

09/24 --- create the other file by looking for the specific classes like the links file (how it has link['href'])
        this will allow creation of the dictionary more
